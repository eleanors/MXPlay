Developers can access cloud services through Client APIs, or integrate with third-party servers. Through the Cloud API and Client API, the following services are provided:</p><p>(1) Cloud data storage – Enable “Cloud Dev” and design the database, APICloud will generate RESTful APIs for you. APICloud allows you to manipulate database through APIs in the MCM module, which saves a great deal of server-side dev efforts. Additionally, APICloud provides API metrics, data transfer statistics, storage statistics, API testing, etc.</p><p>(2) Push – APICloud provides complete push services. The Client API provides the push module and a complete messaging system for developers. Through open APIs, third-party services can access APICloud servers, make push requests, or acquire push analytics info. </p><p>(3) App Mgt – App mgt includes packaging, version release, auto update, incremental update, online fixing, disabling buggy versions, etc. </p><p>(4) Analytics – Provide developers with comprehensive statistical data. Upload custom analytics data to APICloud server through the Client API. The Cloud API enables integration with third-party servers to acquire analytics info.</p><p>(5) Custom Modules – APICloud has an open module mechanism. Developers only need to build standard-based modules with specific functionality and upload them to the module library. Then the modules will be available to all developers.</p><p>(6) Code Host – Easy to synchronize project code to the cloud using APICloud Studio to build apps.</p>",

In consideration of the inefficiency of https transmission, APICloud provides a complete data encryption/decryption solution from the client to the cloud. Encrypted data is transmitted under http protocol.</p><p>For server stability, all the services of APICloud are based on the big data infrastructure and support tens of millions users.
